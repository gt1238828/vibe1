# Blueprint: Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a modern web application that generates and displays a set of random lottery numbers. It features a polished UI with glassmorphism effects and a theme switcher.

## Project Outline

### Version 1.0
*   **HTML Structure (`index.html`):** Basic layout with heading, container, and button.
*   **Styling (`style.css`):** Centered layout, clean color scheme, responsive design.
*   **Functionality (`main.js`):** Random number generation and dynamic display.

### Version 1.1 (Enhancement)
*   **Modern Aesthetics:** Added 'Poppins' typography, background gradients, and ball animations.
*   **Animated Interaction:** Lotto balls appear one by one with a pop-in effect.

### Version 1.2 (Current)
*   **Theme Switcher:** Added Dark Mode and Light Mode support.
*   **Modern CSS:** Implemented theme variables using `oklch` color space and CSS custom properties.
*   **Glassmorphism:** Enhanced the main container with blur effects and semi-transparent borders.
*   **Persistence:** Theme preference is saved in `localStorage`.
*   **Accessibility:** Added theme toggle button with appropriate labels.

## Current Plan

**Request:** Add Dark/Light mode and deploy via git.

**Steps:**
1.  Define CSS variables for light/dark themes in `style.css`.
2.  Add a theme toggle button in `index.html`.
3.  Implement theme switching and persistence logic in `main.js`.
4.  Update `blueprint.md` to reflect changes.
5.  Push changes to GitHub.
