# Blueprint: Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a simple web application that generates and displays a set of random lottery numbers. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web standards.

## Project Outline

### Version 1.0
*   **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
    *   A main heading for the application title.
    *   A container element to hold the generated lottery balls.
    *   A button to trigger the number generation.
*   **Styling (`style.css`):**
    *   Centered layout.
    *   A clean, modern color scheme.
    *   Visually distinct "lotto balls" for the numbers.
    *   Responsive design for different screen sizes.
*   **Functionality (`main.js`):**
    *   A function to generate a set of unique random numbers within a specified range.
    *   An event listener on the button to trigger the generation and display of the numbers.
    *   The generated numbers are dynamically added to the HTML.

    *   Add a subtle background gradient and noise texture.
    *   Add a "pop-in" animation for the lotto balls.
    *   Enhance the button with a glowing hover effect.
    *   Improve the color palette for the balls to be more vibrant.
4.  **Modify `main.js`:**
